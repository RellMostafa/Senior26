                    <p>It's me, Malakkkk — 16 years old right now (and no, I'm not copying anyone with this part 🤭)</p>
                    <p>I hope that one day I'll look back and read this message when I've finally become a dentistttt 🦷💖.</p>
                    
                    <p>I met my Marioma back in the 2nd preparatory by coincidence, we had just talked on a call the day before even though we weren't that close back then. But that's how the best friendships starts, right?<br>
                    She'll always be my best person and safe zone🥹💗.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then, in 3rd year, our little gang became complete with Mayadah, Maryam Mohamed, and Maryam Osama. I love them all so much. They're the sweetest souls, and I'm honestly so lucky to have met them. Even the rest of our class were kind and different from any other group😂</p>
                    
                    <p>I knew I'd miss everyone, but not this fast.<br>
                    Where's Miss Hend now😞?</p>
                    
                    <p>I really hope we never lose contact and that we always remember each other. Our class was truly one of a kind, something that can never be replaced 😋💫</p>
                    
                    <p>May all my girls be happy, successful, and achieve everything they dream of.<br>
                    And no matter what happens, I'll always be there loving you all and cheering for you. Even though I'm the youngest one, I hope my words mean something someday. 💖<br>
                    We might grow up, but I'll never forget the laughter, chaos, and love.</p>
                    
                    <p>You guys are going to be my best chapter forever 💛.</p>
